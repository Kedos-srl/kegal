      - If you reject the post explain why, Else just reply with an OK without adding anything else
      ## POST
      $post
      ## OUTPUT
      Generate the final json output by following the steps below:
      1. Read the following schema:
          ```json 
              {
                "type": "object",
                "description": "This is the schema of the response object",
                "properties": {
                  "validation": {
                    "type": "boolean",
                    "description": "If you reject the post set false, Else set true"
                  },
                  "response_txt": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Your response"
                  }
                },
                "required": [

                ]
              }
          ```
      2. For each element of the schema generate a corresponding valid key according to its description
      3. Make sure you generate a valid json,  you must avoid to output json schema
      4. Example of what I want:
         Schema: { "type": "object", "properties": { "response": { "type": "string" }, "validation": { "type": "validation" } } }
         Expected response: { "response": "loren ipusm", "validation": true }
